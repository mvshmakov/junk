1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:08,350
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. About 6 percent of
everything you say and read and write is

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,970
the

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:18,240
"the" - is the most used word in the
English language. About one out of every

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:25,080
16 words we encounter on a daily basis
is "the." The top 20 most common English

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,210
words in order are "the," "of," "and," "to," "a," "in," "is," "I," "that," "it," "for," "you,"

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:39,460
"was," "with," "on," "as," "have," "but," "be," "they."
That's a fun fact. A piece of trivia but it's

7
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,970
also more. You see, whether the most
commonly used words are ranked across an

8
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:51,530
entire language, or in just one book or
article, almost every time a bizarre

9
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:57,880
pattern emerges. The second most used
word will appear about half as often as

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,559
the most used. The third one third as
often. The fourth one fourth as often. The

11
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,640
fifth one fifth as often. The sixth one sixth
as often, and so on all the way down.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,970
Seriously. For some reason, the amount of
times a word is used is just

13
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:23,280
proportional to one over its rank. Word
frequency and ranking on a log log graph

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,909
follow a nice straight line. A power-law.
This phenomenon is called Zipf's Law and

15
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:38,409
it doesn't only apply to English. It also
applies to other languages, like, well,

16
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:39,380
all of them.

17
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,380
Even ancient languages we haven't been
able to translate yet.

18
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,350
And here's the thing. We have no idea why.
It's surprising that something as

19
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:56,390
complex as reality should be conveyed by
something as creative as language in

20
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:03,560
such a predictable way. How predictable?
Well, watch this. According to WordCount.org,

21
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,630
which ranks words as found in the
British National Corpus, "sauce" is the

22
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:15,950
5,555th most common English word.
Now, here is a list of how many times

23
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,360
every word on Wikipedia and in the
entire Gutenberg Corpus of tens of

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,940
thousands of public domain books shows
up. The most used word, 'the,' shows up about

25
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,470
181 million times. Knowing these two
things, we can estimate that the word

26
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,540
"sauce" should appear about thirty
thousand times on Wikipedia and

27
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,220
Gutenberg combined.
And it pretty much does.

28
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,100
What gives? The world is chaotic. Things are
distributed in myriad of ways, not just

29
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,090
power laws. And language is personal,

30
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,520
intentional, idiosyncratic. What about the
world and ourselves could cause such

31
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:08,140
complex activities and behaviors to
follow such a basic rule? We literally

32
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,740
don't know. More than a century of
research has yet to close the case.

33
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:20,020
Moreover, Zipf's law doesn't just
mysteriously describe word use. It's

34
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,810
also found in city populations, solar
flare intensities, protein sequences and

35
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,460
immune receptors, the amount of traffic
websites get, earthquake magnitudes, the

36
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,980
number of times academic papers are
cited, last names, the firing patterns of

37
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,720
neural networks, ingredients used in
cookbooks, the number of phone calls

38
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,360
people received, the diameter of Moon
craters, the number of people that die

39
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,620
in wars, the popularity of opening chess
moves, even the rate at which we forget.

40
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,780
There are plenty of theories about why
language is 'zipf-y,' but no firm conclusions

41
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,220
and this video doesn't contain a
definite explanation either. Sorry, I know

42
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,280
that's a bummer, since we appear to like
knowing more than mystery. But that said,

43
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,970
we also ask more than we answer. So
let's dive into Zipf's ramifications, some

44
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,440
related patterns, some possible
explanations and the depth of the

45
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,320
mystery itself.
Zipf's law was popularized by George Zipf,

46
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,660
a linguist at Harvard University. It is a
discrete form of the continuous Pareto

47
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:35,070
distribution from which we get the
Pareto Principle. Because so many

48
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,070
real-world processes behave this way,
the Pareto Principle tells us that, as a rule

49
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:47,729
of thumb, it's worth assuming that 20% of
the causes are responsible for 80% of

50
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:49,020
the outcome,

51
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,349
like in language, where the most
frequently used 18 percent of words

52
00:04:54,349 --> 00:05:02,060
account for over 80% of word occurrences.
In 1896, Vilfredo Pareto showed that

53
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,300
approximately 80% of the land in Italy
was owned by just twenty percent of the

54
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,690
population. It is said that he later
noticed in his garden 20 percent of his

55
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:20,440
pea pods contained eighty percent of the
peas. He and other researchers looked at

56
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,940
other datasets and found that this 80-20
imbalance comes up a lot in the world.

57
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:35,229
The richest 20% of humans have 82.7% of
the world's income. In the US, 20% of

58
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:41,050
patients use eighty percent of health
care resources. In 2002, Microsoft

59
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,610
reported that 80% of the errors and
crashes in Windows and Office are caused

60
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,659
by 20% of the bugs detected. A common
rule of thumb in the business world

61
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:57,419
states that 20% of your customers are
responsible for 80% of your profits and

62
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,110
eighty percent of the complaints you
receive will come from 20% of your

63
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:08,639
customers. A book titled "The 80/20 Principle"
even says that in a home or

64
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,779
office,

65
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:16,919
20% of the carpet receives 80 percent of
the wear. Oh, and as Woody Allen famously

66
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:24,909
said, "eighty percent of success is just
showing up." The Pareto Principle is

67
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:27,699
everywhere, which is good.

68
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:32,680
By focusing on just 20 percent of what's
wrong, you can often expect to solve

69
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,840
eighty percent of the problems. A variety
of different unrelated factors cause

70
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,639
this to be true from case to case, but if
we can get to the bottom of what causes

71
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,930
some of them,

72
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,280
maybe we'll find that one or more of
those mechanisms is responsible for

73
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,930
Zipf's law in language. George Zipf
himself thought languages' interesting rank

74
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,979
frequency distribution was a consequence
of the Principle of Least Effort. The

75
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:07,410
tendency for life and things to follow
the path of least resistance. Zipf believed

76
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,840
it drove much of human behavior and
hypothesized that as language developed

77
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,280
in our species, speakers naturally
preferred drawing from as few words as

78
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,370
possible to get their thoughts out there.
It was easier. But in order to understand

79
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,599
what was being said,

80
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,990
listeners preferred larger vocabularies
that gave more specificity, so that they

81
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,639
had to do less work. The compromise
between listening and speaking, Zipf felt,

82
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:43,310
led to the current state of language.
A few words are used often and many many

83
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,129
many words are used rarely.

84
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:52,039
Recent papers have suggested that having
a few short, often used, predictable words

85
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:57,749
helps dissipate information load density
on listeners, spacing out important vocab

86
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:03,239
so that the information rate is more
constant. This makes sense and much has

87
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:07,830
been learned by applying the least
effort principle to other behaviors, but

88
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,289
later researchers argued that for
language, the explanation was even more

89
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:19,029
simple. Just a few years after Zipf's
seminal paper, Benoit Mandelbrot showed

90
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:24,419
that there may be nothing mysterious
about Zipf's law at all, because even if you

91
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:29,669
just randomly type on a keyboard you
will produce words distributed according

92
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:35,630
to Zipf's law. It's a pretty cool point and
this is why it happens. There are

93
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,769
exponentially more different long words
than short words. For instance, the English

94
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:48,970
alphabet can be used to make 26 one
letter words, but 26 squared 2 letter

95
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:55,709
words. Also, in random typing, whenever the
space bar is pressed a word terminates.

96
00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:00,939
Since there's always a certain chance that
the space bar will be pressed, longer

97
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:03,069
stretches of time before it happens

98
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:08,160
are exponentially less likely than
shorter ones. The combination of these

99
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,720
exponentials is pretty 'Zipf-y.'
For example, if all 26 letters and the

100
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,130
spacebar are equally likely to be typed,
after a letter is typed and a word has

101
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,389
begun, the probability that the next
input will be a space, thus creating a

102
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:31,579
one letter word, is just one in 27.
And sure enough, if you randomly generate

103
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:39,240
characters or hire a proverbial typing
monkey, about one out of every 27 or 3.7

104
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,769
percent of the stuff between spaces,
will be single letters. Two letter words

105
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:50,920
appear when after beginning a word any
character but the space bar is hit - a 26

106
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,620
in 27 chance and then the space bar.

107
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,980
A three-letter word is the probability
of a letter, another letter and then a

108
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,350
space. If we divide by the number of
unique words of each length there can be,

109
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,950
we get the frequency of occurrence
expected for any particular word given

110
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,950
its length. For example, the letter V will
make up about 0.142 percent of

111
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:24,440
random typing. The word "Vsauce"
0.0000000993 percent. Longer words are

112
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,530
less likely, but watch this. Let's spread
these frequencies out according to the

113
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:35,570
ranks they'd take up on a most often
used list. There are 26 possible one

114
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,640
letter words, so each of the top 26
ranked words are expected to occur

115
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,940
about this often. The next 676 ranks will be taken up

116
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,700
by two letter words that show up about
this often. If we extend each frequency

117
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,980
according to how many members it has,
we get Zipf. Subsequent researchers have

118
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,160
detailed how changing up the initial
conditions can smooth the steps out. Our

119
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,180
mysterious distribution has been created
out of nothing but the inevitabilities

120
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,920
of math.

121
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,000
So maybe there is no mystery. Maybe words
are just the result of humans randomly

122
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,339
segmenting the observable world and the
mental world into labels and Zipf's law

123
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:26,739
describes what naturally happens when
you do that. Case closed. and as always

124
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,240
And as always,

125
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,560
thanks for... wait a minute!

126
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,420
Actual language is very different from
random typing. Communication is

127
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,040
deterministic to a certain extent.
Utterances and topics arrive based on

128
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,139
what was said before. And the vocabulary
we have to work with certainly isn't the

129
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:51,539
result of purely random naming.
For example, the monkey typing model can't

130
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,440
explain why even the names of the
elements, the planets and the days of the

131
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,040
week are used in language according to
Zipf's law. Sets like these are constrained

132
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,410
by the natural world and they're not the
result of us randomly segmenting the

133
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:12,269
world into labels. Furthermore, when given
a list of novel words, words they've

134
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,670
never heard or used before, like when
prompted to write a story about alien

135
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:21,930
creatures with strange names, people will
naturally tend to use the name of one

136
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:29,750
alien twice as often as another, three
times as often as another... Zipf's law appears to

137
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:35,550
be built into our brains. Perhaps there
is something about the way thoughts and

138
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,529
topics of discussion ebb and flow that
contributes to Zipf's law.

139
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:44,839
Another way 'Zipf-ian' distributions
occur is via processes that change

140
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,300
according to how they've previously
operated. These are called preferential

141
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,209
attachment processes.
They occur when something - money, views,

142
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,990
attention, variation, friends, jobs,
anything really is given out according

143
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,749
to how much is already possessed.
To go back to the carpet example, if most

144
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:11,309
people walk from the living room to the
kitchen across a certain path, furniture

145
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:17,990
will be placed elsewhere, making that
path even more popular. The more views

146
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,470
a video or image or post has,
the more likely it is to get recommended

147
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:28,209
automatically or make the news for
having so many views, both of which give

148
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,249
it more views.

149
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:34,600
It's like a snowball rolling down a
snowy hill. The more snow it accumulates, the

150
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,949
bigger its surface area becomes for
collecting more and the faster it grows.

151
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:43,790
There doesn't have to be a deliberate
choice driving a preferential attachment

152
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:50,649
process. It can happen naturally. Try this.
Take a bunch of paper clips and grab any

153
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,170
two at random.

154
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,720
Link them together and then throw them
back in the pile. Now, repeat over and

155
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,020
over again. If you grab paper clips that
are already part of a chain, link 'em anyway.

156
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,100
More often than not after a while
you will have a distribution that looks

157
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,880
'Zipf-ian.' A small number of chains
contain a disproportionate amount of the

158
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,800
total paperclip count. This is simply
because the longer a chain gets, the

159
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,290
greater proportion of the whole it
contains, which gives it a better chance

160
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:26,190
of being picked up in the future and
consequently made even longer. The rich

161
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:33,420
get richer, the big get bigger,
the popular get popular-er. It's just math.

162
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:39,380
Perhaps languages' Zipf mystery is, if not
caused by it, at least strengthened by

163
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:45,900
preferential attachment. Once a word is
used, it's more likely to be used again soon.

164
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,420
Critical points may play a role as well.

165
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,560
Writing and conversation often stick to a
topic until a critical point is reached

166
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,420
and the subject is changed and
the vocabulary shifts. Processes like these

167
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:05,060
are known to result in power laws. So, in
the end, it seems tenable that all these

168
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:11,260
mechanisms might collude to make Zipf's
law the most natural way for language to

169
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,970
be. Perhaps some of our vocabulary and
grammar was developed randomly, according

170
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,560
to Mandelbrot's theory. And the natural
way conversation and discussion follow

171
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,949
preferential attachment and criticality,
coupled with the principle of least

172
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:31,920
effort when speaking and listening are
all responsible for the relationship

173
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,010
between word rank and frequency.

174
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:40,170
It's a shame that the answer isn't
simpler, but it's fascinating because of

175
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,140
the consequences it has on what
communication is made of. Roughly

176
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:52,210
speaking, and this is mind blowing, nearly
half of any book, conversation or article

177
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:58,500
will be nothing but the same 50 to 100
words. And nearly the other half will be

178
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,870
words that appear in that selection only
once. That's not so surprising when you

179
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:11,690
consider the fact that one word accounts
for 6 percent of what we say. The top 25

180
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:18,300
most used words make up about a third of
everything we say and the top 100 about

181
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:25,400
half. Seriously. I mean, whether it's all the
words in "Wet Hot American Summer," or all

182
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,420
the words in Plato's "Complete Works" or
in the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe

183
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:37,920
or the Bible itself, only about 100 words
are used for nearly half of everything

184
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:48,360
written or said. In Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland 44% and in Tom Sawyer 49.8%

185
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:55,260
of the unique words used appear only
once in the book. A word that is used

186
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:01,300
only once in a given selection of words
is called a 'hapax legomenon.'

187
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,120
Hapax legomena are vitally important to
understanding languages. If a word has

188
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,699
only been found once in the entire known
collection of an ancient language, it can

189
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,640
be very difficult to figure out what it
means. Now, there is no corpus of

190
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,550
everything ever said or written in
English, but there are very very large

191
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:29,240
collections and it's fun to find hapax legomena in them.
For instance, and this

192
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,360
probably won't be the case after I
mention it, but the word "quizzaciously"

193
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:41,600
is in the Oxford English Dictionary, but
appears nowhere on Wikipedia or in the

194
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,000
Gutenberg corpus or in the British
National Corpus or the American National

195
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,650
Corpus, but it does appear when searched in
just one result on Google. Fittingly, in a

196
00:17:53,650 --> 00:18:01,730
book titled "ElderSpeak" that lists it
as a 'rare word.' Quizzaciously, by the way,

197
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,600
means "in a mocking manner," as in
"The paradist rattled off quizzaciously,

198
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,919
'Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. But who is Michael
and how much does here

199
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:20,590
weigh?'" It's a little sad that quizzaciously
has been used so infrequently. It's a

200
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:26,910
fun word, but that's the way things go in
a 'Zipf-ian' system. Some things get all the

201
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:33,540
love, some get little. Most of what you
experience on a day-to-day basis is

202
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:39,910
forgotten, forgettable. The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows, as it often does, has a

203
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:45,970
word for this - Olēka - the awareness of how
few days are memorable.

204
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:52,170
I've been alive for almost 11,000 days
but I couldn't tell you something about

205
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,780
each one of them. I mean, not even close.

206
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:00,730
Most of what we do and see and think and
say and hear and feel is forgotten

207
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:07,510
at a rate quite similar to Zipf's law,
which makes sense. If a number of factors

208
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,290
naturally selected for thinking and
talking about the world with tools in

209
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:17,250
a 'Zipf-ian' way, it makes sense we'd
remember it that way too. Some things

210
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:24,610
really well, most things hardly at all.
But it bums me out sometimes because it

211
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,840
means that so much is forgotten,
even things that at the time you thought you

212
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,500
could never forget. My locker number -

213
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,230
senior year - its combination, the jokes
I liked when I saw a comedian on stage,

214
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:45,150
the names of people I saw every day 10
years ago. So many memories are gone. When

215
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,870
I look at all the books I've read and
realize that I can't remember every

216
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,570
detail from them, it's a little
disappointing. I mean, why even bother if

217
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:58,030
the Pareto Principle dictates that my
'Zipf-ian' mind will consciously remember

218
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:04,280
pretty much only the titles and a few
basic reactions years later

219
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,260
Ralph Waldo Emerson makes me feel better.
He once said, "I cannot remember the books

220
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:15,720
I've read any more than the meals I have
eaten. Even so, they have made me."

221
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,049
And as always,

222
00:20:19,049 --> 00:00:00,000
thanks for watching.
